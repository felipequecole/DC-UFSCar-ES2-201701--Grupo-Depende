"Prophet -- A Link-Predictor to Learn New Rules on NELL","A. P. Appel; E. R. Hruschka Junior","CEUNES, Fed.

NELL is a never ending language learner system that has the ability to continuously learn to extract structured information from unstructured text (fetched from web pages) and map this information to a continuously growing knowledge base. NELL's knowledge base can be seen as a complex network, allowing us to apply graph mining techniques to extract new knowledge and enhance the system performance. In this paper we present Prophet, a link prediction component that can be connected to NELL allowing the it to infer new rules and misplaced connections among nodes, thus, helping the never-ending system to learn more and better each day. We also show that Prophet can extract new knowledge that cannot be obtained using traditional first order rule extraction procedures.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-0-7695-4409-0; POD:978-1-4673-0005-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2011.142","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137479","common neighbors;graph mining;link prediction;never-ending-learning","Complex networks;Data mining;Joining processes;Knowledge based systems;Ontologies;Prediction algorithms","data mining;data models;graph theory;knowledge acquisition","NELL knowledge base;Prophet;edge prediction;first order rule extraction procedures;graph mining techniques;graph-based data models;knowledge extraction;language learner system;link prediction component;never-ending system;structured information extraction;unstructured text","","5","","8","","","","11-11 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is one of many series being made on the vastly complicated mechanisms by which the Navy controls the fire of its guns. The original request came from the Fire Control and Gunner's Mates Schools in July, 1942, was approved, and assigned to a producer. Training Film Branch personnel, School staff, and producer's representative began research; began writing; began production. Some of the sailing was smooth, for possible snags had been foreseen. But others had not been anticipated. These included the use of color in presenting complicated, difficult, and technical material; and the changes and modifications in equipment that were effected after films were started but before they were completed. Securing writers with the necessary training and experience was difficult owing to the nature of the subject matter. â€” But these problems were tackled as they came along, and most of them have been solved, even including a revision of the curriculum of the Fire Control School in order to make full use of films.","0097-5834;00975834","","10.5594/J07396","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7252385","","","","","","","","","","","","Feb. 1944","","SMPTE","SMPTE Journals & Magazines"
"Measuring the light intensity of a hybrid powered CFL and LED lighting using 3D electronic vision in rotation of the solar panel","R. Nell; M. Kahn","Department of Electrical Engineering, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, South Africa","2012 Proceedings of the 20th Domestic Use of Energy Conference","20120510","2012","","","111","115","This paper describes how 3D electronic vision can be used in rotation of the solar panel for optimal use of sunlight to power an incandescent, CFL and LED light. The light intensity from the CFL and LED lighting powered by the solar panel is measured and how the solar panel, battery setup and grid supply is used in a hybrid electrical setup for both daytime and night time lighting. The method used is to measure the light intensity of the incandescent, CFL and LED lighting. To obtain optimal use of the solar panel, the 3D vision formula is used to rotate the solar panel. The CFL and LED light intensity measurements are obtained as daytime lightning are needed in certain buildings. As different ambient conditions occur during daytime, the effect of a half shadow and full shadow on the solar panel is investigating. The hybrid electrical supply setup was designed and the incandescent, CFL and LED lights were powered from the solar panel. The output light intensity of the incandescent, CFL and LED lights were measured with the solar panel covered in full shadow, half shadow and no shadow. The use of CFL and LED lights with a solar panel and battery can apply lightning for daytime and night time. The light intensity of both is discussed powered by the solar panel during different ambient conditions.","","Electronic:978-0-9814311-7-8; POD:978-1-4673-1232-5","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198219","","Current measurement;Light emitting diodes;Light sources;Power measurement;Resistors;Sun;Voltage measurement","daylighting;filament lamps;fluorescent lamps;light emitting diodes;solar cells","3D electronic vision;LED lighting;battery setup;daytime lighting;grid supply;hybrid electrical setup;hybrid powered CFL;incandescent lamp;light intensity measurements;night time lighting;solar panel","","0","","6","","","","3-4 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"The use of 3D electronic vision for effective utilization of solar power in a hybrid electrical supply setup","R. Nell; M. Kahn","Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, South Africa","2011 Proceedings of the 8th Conference on the Industrial and Commercial Use of Energy","20111003","2011","","","215","222","Three-dimensional (3D) electronic vision can provide recognition of objects and also orientation of an object to its surrounding. With recognition of objects, possible interaction can be obtained and readjustment of their position. When a solar panel is used in a hybrid electrical supply setup, recognition of objects and their casting shadow can be used to reposition a solar panel to obtain effective utilization of sunlight. Having a hybrid setup (electrical supply, wind energy and solar energy) in a confined space, repositioning the solar panel to obtain direct sunlight when a shadow is cast onto it, can improve efficiency. This paper will explain how 3D electronic vision can be used to maximise the use of a solar panel in a hybrid electrical supply setup. The aim is to describe how 3D electronic vision can be used to reposition a solar panel to improve efficiency in a hybrid electrical supply setup. The method used was to explain how electrical supply, wind power as well as solar power can effectively be used with a 3D visualization setup. Improve efficiency of a solar panel is obtained when positioned in direct sunlight. The positioning of the solar panel is important to ensure no shadow is cast onto it. Using 3D electronic vision, the shadow and surrounding objects can be recognized and the solar panel is repositioned to receive direct sunlight. The hybrid electrical supply system was described and the setup of the 3D electronic vision to recognise objects and their casting shadow in the area of the solar panel is explained. Compared to direct sunlight on the solar panel, the output power has decreased by 12% when a half shadow is cast onto it and the output power has decreased by 89% when a full shadow is cast onto it. With the feedback from the vision system, the solar panel can be repositioned to obtain direct sunlight to improve efficiency. The hybrid electrical supply setup with a solar panel can be utilized in a confined space in industry and the solar pan- - el can be reposition for improve efficiency.","2166-0581;21660581","Electronic:978-0-9814311-6-1; POD:978-1-4577-1745-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6033069","3D;artefact;hybrid;solar energy;xyz","Accuracy;Irrigation;Resistors;Three dimensional displays;Visualization","hybrid power systems;object recognition;solar power stations;sunlight;wind power plants","3D electronic vision;hybrid electrical supply setup;object orientation;object recognition;shadow casting;solar panel;solar panel reposition;solar power;sunlight utilization;three-dimensional electronic vision;wind power","","1","","9","","","","16-17 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
